# IoT Workshop Plan

1. **Introduction to IoT, Cloud and Embedded Systems**
```In this module we will discuss the basics of IoT, IoT Devices , Embedded systems, Internet based communications & Cloud. How the concept of Iot Evolved along with Internet. One simple use case of IoT will be discussed.```
    
2. **IoT Fundamentals**
     This section will cover the concepts of Sensors & Actuators which used in IoT and how they are integrated with a computer.  An interation of a simple digital sensor will be covered as live hands on session. Need to Cyber security in IoT will also be discussed. A brief Introduction of Real Time Operating system will also be covered.

3. **IoT Platforms**
     We will be discussing the what exactly it means by an IoT platform, what are basic components of an IoT platform, what are the commercial and opensource IoT platforms available and how we can make use of them for projects. This will cover IoT databases, Visualization, Authentication Data processing, some parts of Analytics, and other Utilities used for
by IoT Designers.

4. **Communications Technologies used for  IoT**
Internet is the platform for communication between Devices and end users. However there are many Application layer technolgies like Webservices, MQTT etc were developed to solve specific problems , these along with concepts of Internet Protocol address, (IP address) will be covered. In addition, Physical communication Technologies, Like LoRA, ZigBEE, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi will also be discussed.

5. **IoT and Social Media Integration**
IoT and social media has lot of interesting Uses cases which are yet to be deployed. For example can you think of a snack wending machine at your college/ office which
tweets to you about the arrival of fresh stock, new snacks introduced, discounts etc to your mobile phone ? You can check with the wending machine from your mobile whether 
it is functional and has stock of your favorite snack, and payment directly thorugh Google Pay instead of dropping currency ? We will discuss how we can design one such wending machine.

6. **IoT Deployments for real world applications**
     What is that is needed to develop a real world IoT application like tools, programming languages, hardware boards, sensors and actuators, mark up languages will be 
     discussed here. We will take a End of use case and see how these are used in building a real world application
     
7. **Advanced IoT**
Machine Learning & Artificial intellegence has found in connection with IoT too. IoT is a rich field for applying  Machine learning.  We will explain what exactly is ML and how it is used in IoT with a practical illustration.

8. **IoT Case studies**

     8.1. **IoT for residential apartments**
     
          8.1.1. Water monitoring
          8.1.2. Power monitoring 
          8.1.3. Security
          8.1.4. Environment Monitoring
          
     8.2. **IoT for Manfacturing Plants**
     
         8.2.1. Condition Monitoroing on machines
         8.2.2. Anomaly detection (Analytics in IoT)
         
     8.3. **IoT for security application**
         
9. **Hands-on with Iot (Live)**

   9.1. Simple Weather monitoring stations (no wind speed at the moment)
   
   9.2. Industrial Equipment Monitoring (called Condition Monitoring)
   
   9.3. Health Monitoring 
   
   9.4. Environmental Monitoring
   
10. **Future Direction**
11. **Open house discussion with Participants on their questions.**
